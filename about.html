                        Balboa is bred between a purebred Siberian Husky (father) and purebred American Akita (mother). Balboa has overlapping traits from both breeds. He is striking in appearance; his coat is mainly inherited from the Akita; heterochromia causes one eye to be blue and the other brown. His weight is 75 lbs, he is incredibly strong. Balboa loves to be around people, he is extremely intelligent and equally curious. Balboa has a very high prey drive but has been socialized around domestic animals including cats and a rabbit. Balboa is independent, observant and very affectionate but on his terms. He rarely barks and when he does its generally a single bark. Balboa is calm in the home but has high energy and incredible stamina which necessitates daily vigorous exercise and mental stimulation.

                        </span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="uppercase italic">Siberian Husky</span>, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified. The graceful, medium-sized Siberian Husky's almond-shaped eyes can be either brown or blue and sometimes one of each and convey a keen but amiable and even mischievous expression. Quick and nimble-footed, Siberians are known for their powerful but seemingly effortless gait. Tipping the scales at no more than 60 pounds, they are noticeably smaller and lighter than their burly cousin, the Alaskan Malamute. As born pack dogs, they enjoy family life and get on well with other dogs. The Sibe's innate friendliness render them indifferent watchdogs. These are energetic dogs who can't resist chasing small animals, so secure running room is a must. An attractive feature of the breed: Sibes are naturally clean, with little doggy odor.
                        <br><br>
                        Fortunately, the Siberian Husky is a relatively healthy breed. Responsible breeders screen their breeding stock for health problems such as juvenile cataracts, and the breed's national parent club, the Siberian Husky Club of America, has strict guidelines to help reduce reported cases. Beginning at 12 months of age, all Siberians who potentially will be part of a breeding program should be examined by a canine ophthalmologist. The exam is then repeated on a yearly basis. New screenings and tests are being constantly being developed to help breeders in their selection of a potential dam and sire. Knowledgeable breeding practices ensure the future health of the breed. Owners of working Siberians need to closely monitor each dog to be able to recognize when something just isn't right. Having a veterinarian familiar with working dogs is an advantage.

                        <br><br>
                        Siberians are active, athletic dogs who need a lot of exercise. They are a working breed and happiest when they have a function to perform. Regular exercise is important both physically and mentally, and doing activities together strengthens the bond between dog and owner. Siberians were bred to run and will do so at every opportunity; it is vital to keep the dog on a leash, in harness, or in a fenced yard at all times. There are several AKC-sponsored activities that can be enjoyed by dog and owners: rally, agility, and obedience are a few. A busy and active Siberian is a happy and healthy Siberian. This breed is also very adaptable, and for those who live in a more urban setting, daily walks or doggie play groups can provide great exercise.

                        <br><br>
                        The Siberian Husky’s compact body, well-furred coat, erect ears, and thick, sickle-shaped tail immediately suggest the breed’s northern heritage. The breed’s ancestors were originally bred in northeastern Asia by the Chukchi people and were kept as companion dogs for their families as well as endurance sled dogs.
                        <br><br>
                        When changing climate conditions forced the semi-nomadic Chukchi to expand their hunting grounds or perish, they rose to the challenge by developing a sled dog capable of hauling light loads over vast expanses of frozen wasteland in sub-zero temperatures, with a minimum expenditure of energy. The Chukchi, isolated from the rest of the world, were able to maintain the purity of their sled teams for many generations. The dogs they developed were the direct forerunners of today’s Siberian Husky.
                        <br><br>
                        Siberians caught the eye of the public when they began winning sled races in the early 1900s, but they made headlines in 1925 when a legendary musher Leonhard Seppala led a relay of Siberian Huskies 658 miles in only five and a half days to rush a lifesaving serum to Nome, Alaska, where an epidemic of diphtheria had broken out. The thrilling “serum run,” reported breathlessly in newspapers around the world, won Siberians a popularity that has not abated to this day. Balto, who was Seppala’s lead dog on the final leg of the journey, remains one of the most honored hero dogs in canine history; a statue of him stands in New York City’s Central Park.
                        <br><br>
                        Mushers still keep packs of sledding Siberians for fun and sport throughout North America. Less adventurous devotees of the breed simply enjoy the company of this sociable, gentle companion.

                        </span>
                        <br><br>
                        <span class="uppercase italic">Akita</span> is muscular, double-coated dogs of ancient Japanese lineage famous for her dignity, courage, and loyalty. In her native land, she's venerated as family protectors and symbols of good health, happiness, and long life.
                        <br><br>
                        Akitas are burly, heavy-boned spitz-type dogs of imposing stature. Standing 24 to 28 inches at the shoulder, Akitas have a dense coat that comes in several colors, including white. The head is broad and massive, and is balanced in the rear by a full, curled-over tail. The erect ears and dark, shining eyes contribute to an expression of alertness, a hallmark of the breed.     Akitas are quiet, fastidious dogs. Wary of strangers and often intolerant of other animals, Akitas will gladly share their silly, affectionate side with family and friends. They thrive on human companionship. The large, independent-thinking Akita is hardwired for protecting those they love. They must be well socialized from birth with people and other dogs.
                        <br><br>
                        Like many dogs, Akitas can experience bloat, a sudden, life-threatening condition where the stomach can twist without veterinary intervention. Bloat is a medical emergency, and Akita owners should learn to recognize the signs. Prospective owners should be sure to work with a reputable breeder who tests his or her breeding stock for health concerns such as eye and thyroid disorders, and hip dysplasia, a malformation of the hip joints that can cause pain and arthritis.

                        </ul>
                        <br><br>
                        The Akita is generally not a highly active breed but does require moderate exercise. A jog or brisk walk around the block at least once a day can meet the needs of most individuals of the breed. Akitas also enjoy playing energetically. Although they are large dogs, males often weigh more than 100 pounds, with sufficient daily exercise Akitas can do well in a relatively small home. They are hardy dogs bred to withstand the harsh outdoor conditions of northern Japan, but they were bred as housedogs and guardians as well as hunters and adapt very well to life in the home.
                        <br><br>
                        Akitas are very intelligent and loyal but also have an independent, headstrong nature. As large and very powerful dogs, it is vital that they are trained consistently, beginning in puppyhood. They are instinctive guardians, so it's especially important that Akitas have early and extensive socialization when young. They must learn to accept a wide variety of strangers and not perceive them as a threat. Because of their independence and strong prey drive, they should never be off lead in an unsecured area. Akitas tend to be aggressive toward other dogs, particularly of the same sex, and extreme caution should be used in canine interactions.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        Akitas are Japan’s entry in the ancient canine clan of spitz-type dogs bred around the world on the globe’s northern latitudes. The breed as we know it was developed in the early 17th century in the Akita prefecture of northern Japan. It is said that the emperor banished a wayward nobleman to the prefecture, the northernmost province of the island of Honshu, where the nobleman was ordered to live out his days as a provincial ruler. As it happens, this exiled aristocrat was an ardent dog man and encouraged the barons under his sway to compete in the breeding of a large, versatile hunting dog. Generations of selective breeding produced the Akita, a powerful hunter with a strong work ethic and stout heart who worked in packs on such big game as wild boar, deer, and the fearsome Yezo bear. Owning Akitas was once restricted to the imperial family and their court. In more recent times, just plain folks the world over have employed their Akitas as world-class family guardians.
                        <br><br>
                        Akitas have for centuries been the object of myth and legend and occupy a special place in Japanese culture. When a child is born, the parents will usually receive an Akita figurine signifying happiness and long life, in keeping with an old Japanese tradition. A famously loyal Akita of the 1920s named Hachiko is among Japan’s most cherished symbols.
                        <br><br>
                        Various times during the Akita’s long history, the breed teetered on the brink of extinction. To ensure the Akita’s survival, a Japanese national breed club was founded in 1927. Helen Keller is credited with bringing the first Akita to the United States, a gift she received while visiting Japan. Akitas caught on in America after WWII, when returning GIs brought them back from the Pacific. The breed entered the AKC Stud Book in 1972.

                            Siberian Husky Origin and Purpose

                        <br>
                        The Siberian Husky was developed untold centuries ago by the Chukchis of Northern Siberia. The Chukchis, a nomadic people, utilized their dogs in many ways - companions for their children, hunters for their food and as their mode of transportation. Siberian Huskies were brought to Alaska in 1909 for racing, proving themselves to be hardy dogs with speed and endurance. It is essential that the breed purpose be retained today. 
                        <br><br>

                        <br>
                        The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working dog, light on his feet, free and graceful in action. He has an inbred desire to run and an independent spirit. His well-furred body, erect ears, and brush tail suggest his northern heritage. He performs his original function in harness most capably, carrying a light load at moderate speed over great distances. His body proportions and form reflect this basic balance of power, speed, endurance and general athletic abilities. The males of the Siberian Husky breed are masculine but never coarse. The bitches are feminine but without weakness of structure. In dogs and bitches, the bone must be medium with firm and well-developed muscles. The coat is soft textured.

                        The characteristic temperament of the Siberian Husky is friendly and gentle, but also alert and energetic. As adults, the breed tends to be aloof and independent. His intelligence, natural workability and eager disposition make him an agreeable companion and willing worker, especially as a sled dog. He does not display the possessive qualities of a guard dog.

                                   The Siberian Husky has a thick, soft, double-coat consisting of a soft, dense, downy undercoat of fur next to the skin, and an outer coat of soft, smooth-texture guard hairs, giving a smooth, full-furred appearance and a clean-cut outline. It should be noted that the absence of undercoat during the shedding season is normal. Trimming of the fur around the feet to present a neater appearance is permissible. Trimming the fur on any other part of the body is not to be condoned and should be severely penalized. All colours (solids and blended shades) and pure white are allowed and all markings. A large variety of markings are found in the Siberian Husky, especially around the head.

                                   Skull of medium size and in proportion to the body; slightly rounded on the top and tapering from the widest point to the eyes. Muzzle of medium length, that is, the distance from the tip of the nose to the stop is equal to the distance from the stop to the occiput. The stop is well defined, and the bridge of the nose is straight from the stop to the tip. In profile, the skull and the muzzle are on parallel planes. The muzzle is of medium width, tapering gradually to the nose, with the tip neither pointed or square. The lips are dark pigmented and close fitting. Eyes are shades of brown or blue, one of each or parti-coloured; all are equally acceptable. The eyes should be almond shaped, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely with well fitting lids. The eye expression is keen, friendly, interested and even mischievous. Ears of medium size, erect, close fitting, set high on the head. They are thick and well furred including hair on the inside. This helps reduce heat loss during the winter months. The ears are slightly arched at the back and strongly erect, with slightly round tips pointing straight up. Teeth Scissor bite, strong and powerful jaws with a full compliment of evenly set teeth (42).

                                   The Siberian Husky’s characteristic gait is smooth and seemingly effortless. When in the show ring, he should be gaited on a loose lead at a moderately fast trot. The dog’s head should move forward and extend in a line with his topline. He should show good reach in the forequarters and good drive in the hindquarters. When moving at a walk, the Siberian Husky may not single track, but as the gait speed increases the legs converge until the pads are falling on a line directly under the longitudinal center of the body, single tracking. The topline remains firm and level.

                        The Akita’s history dates back nearly 400 years and derives its name from the prefecture of Akita in Northern Japan. In 1931 the breed was proclaimed a natural monument by the Japanese Ministry of Education. The government more recently took steps to preserve the breed which is now regarded as a National Treasure. Primarily, the Akita is a working dog. It was used for hunting bear, wild boar and sled work, a companion and protector of children and home.

                        Large, powerful, alert and much substance and heavy bone. The broad head, forming a blunt triangle with deep muzzle. Small eyes and small erect ears carried forward in line with the neck are characteristic of the breed. The large, curled tail, balancing the broad head, is also characteristic of the breed.

                        Alert, responsive, dignified, reserved with strangers. An Akita’s nature is to be intensely loyal to its master.
